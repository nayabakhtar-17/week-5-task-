Stack Implementation using Linked List

Overview

This program implements a Stack data structure using a Linked List to store student information. The Stack class uses a linked list to store Student objects, each representing an individual student with a name and marks. The program provides methods to push students onto the stack, pop students from the stack, display all students, and display the top 3 positions of students with the highest marks.
